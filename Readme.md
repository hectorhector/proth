This program uses the [GMP Library](https://gmplib.org/) to search for Proth Primes. 

Proth Primes are primes in the form of `k*2^n+1`.
A Sierpiński number is a number k where it is impossible to construct a Proth Prime.
The smallest proven Sierpiński number is 78557. 

In the early 2000s, only 17 numbers smaller than 78557 hadn't been proven to NOT be Sierpiński numbers.
Currently, only 5 remain. 
If primes can be found for these 5 k's, 78557 will be proven to be the smallest Sierpiński number.

The status of the 17 are as follows:

4847 -  prime with n=3321063, discovered October 15, 2005
